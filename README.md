# DSPrint

A small collection of scripts to help you print data structures like arrays, ds lists, ds maps and ds grids to the console or a file.

Note: The GMS console currently doesn't use a monospace font, so the formatting might look a bit misaligned for grids, it's best that you output to a file, then open in a Text Editor that uses monospace font and doesn't have wordwrap enabled (if your grid has a large width)
